          <dt>What is it?</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>It's simple: <em>"Made with ❤ in the Soo"</em> is a showcase of websites that were built in Sault Ste. Marie.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Who made it?</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>I made it. My name is <a href="https://ericmoss.ca/">Eric Moss</a>. I'm a graphic designer turned web designer turned web developer.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Why did you make it?</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>I made it for a few reasons. I first saw the idea many years ago in cities like New York and San Francisco, and it caught my attention. The idea of building something to showcase the local tech community has always interested me.</p>
            <p>Overall, these are my goals for this site:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>to empower local developers and designers;</strong></li>
              <li>to put Sault Ste. Marie web development on the map;</li>
              <li>to make web development in SSM feel more like a community;</li>
              <li>and to promote SSM as a tech hub in the north.</li>
            </ul>
